The UI for lead submission was designed to be clean and straightforward, minimizing friction for all employees. The use of distinct tabs, clear call-to-action buttons, and structured lead cards was a direct result of design thinking aimed at improving user efficiency and satisfaction.\",\r\n    approach: \"The module was developed using Flutter with GetX for state management, following a modular architecture within the main Fincare One application.

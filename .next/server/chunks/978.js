Approved changes are automatically executed by a daily cron job, significantly reducing manual intervention from the IT team.",shortDescription:"Flutter module in FincareOne to automate Branch & User Class change requests with a two-level approval workflow based on HRMS hierarchy.",introduction:"This project was conceptualized to address the high volume of manual service tickets for branch and user class modifications. The objective was to build a self-service module within the FincareOne super-app, empowering employees to manage their own operational changes while providing a structured and secure approval framework for management.",problemStatement:"The IT Business-as-usual (BAU) team was inundated with service requests for branch and user class changes, accounting for 30-40% of their ticket volume. This manual process, which relied on approvals via email or other channels, was inefficient, prone to delays, and lacked a centralized audit trail. The bank needed an automated solution to offload this work from the IT team and place the approval authority directly with the relevant business managers.",developmentJourney:"The development process began by mapping out the two-level approval flow based on the HRMS structure. Following the Figma designs, we built distinct UIs for employees and managers using Flutter and GetX. Key features implemented include the request submission form with calendar controls for duration, the manager's approval dashboard with swipeable cards, and API integrations to fetch HRMS data. A significant part of the journey was setting up the daily cron job for executing approved requests and the logic for auto-reverting temporary branch changes.",strugglesAndSolutions:"A key challenge was integrating with the HRMS system to dynamically fetch the correct two-level reporting hierarchy for every employee. This was solved by creating a robust backend service that securely communicates with the HRMS database. Implementing the swipe-to-approve/reject functionality with confirmation dialogs required careful state management to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience. Another challenge was ensuring the cron job was reliable and correctly handled various scenarios, like permanent vs. temporary changes, which was addressed through rigorous testing and scheduling logic.",designThinking:"The design, guided by the provided Figma link, focused on creating a clear and efficient user experience. For employees, the process of raising a request was simplified into a single form. For managers, the design prioritized quick decision-making through an 'at-a-glance' card view with employee details and swipe gestures for actions. The inclusion of a confirmation pop-up for rejections was a key design choice to prevent accidental decisions and capture necessary feedback, enhancing the overall usability and reliability of the workflow.",approach:"The solution was architected as a module within the Flutter-based FincareOne application. We implemented a role-based access system to differentiate between an employee's view and a manager's view. The business logic for the approval workflow and HRMS integration was handled by backend services. A daily cron job was scheduled on the server-side to process all approved requests in a batch, ensuring system changes are made in a controlled manner during off-peak hours. All data related to requests and approvals was stored in a dedicated database schema to maintain a clear audit trail.",conclusion:"The Branch and User Class Change module successfully automated a critical but repetitive administrative task. It provides a secure, auditable, and user-friendly platform that empowers employees and managers, while significantly reducing the burden on the IT team. The project demonstrated how thoughtful application design can streamline internal business processes and improve operational efficiency.",impact:"The module is projected to reduce IT service tickets related to branch and user class changes by 30-40%, freeing up the IT team to focus on more critical tasks.

BMs/BOMs can assign leads from a central queue, while RMs can act on their assigned leads by calling customers and updating statuses.

Branch Managers struggled with efficiently distributing leads to their teams, and Relationship Managers lacked a streamlined interface to act upon and track their assigned leads. There was no unified process for all employees to submit potential leads, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient tracking. The lack of a centralized system made it difficult to monitor lead status and measure conversion effectiveness across the branch network.",developmentJourney:"The development of Cross-Sell v3.0 was guided by detailed user stories and Figma designs. The process began with building the core UI components in Flutter, such as the dynamic lead card widgets and the new landing page. We implemented distinct user flows for BMs/BOMs and RMs, focusing on state management with GetX to handle queues like 'Yet to assign' and 'In Progress'. A key part of the journey was creating the lead submission form with client-side validation and integrating it with the existing 'Create Lead' backend API. The final phase involved linking all screens and ensuring smooth navigation as per the new design.",strugglesAndSolutions:"A primary challenge was implementing the role-based access control to display different UIs and functionalities for BMs, RMs, and other employees. This was solved by fetching the user's role upon login and using conditional rendering within the Flutter widgets. Another challenge was managing the state of leads across different queues ('Yet to assign', 'In Progress', 'Closed') efficiently. We leveraged GetX state management to create reactive data stores that updated the UI in real-time as leads were assigned, actioned, or created. Ensuring the form validations for lead submission were robust and user-friendly also required careful implementation of Flutter's form handling capabilities.",designThinking:"The design process was user-centric, driven by the detailed Figma mockups provided. The core philosophy was to simplify complex workflows into intuitive, role-specific interfaces. For Branch Managers, the design focused on providing a clear overview and quick assignment capabilities. For Relationship Managers, the focus was on enabling swift action on leads. The UI for lead submission was designed to be clean and straightforward, minimizing friction for all employees. The use of distinct tabs, clear call-to-action buttons, and structured lead cards was a direct result of design thinking aimed at improving user efficiency and satisfaction.",approach:"The module was developed using Flutter with GetX for state management, following a modular architecture within the main Fincare One application. We created reusable widgets for lead cards, which could be configured based on the user's role and the lead's status. The front-end logic was separated from the UI, with services dedicated to API interactions, such as creating new leads and updating their status. We adhered strictly to the provided Figma designs for UI implementation and ensured all new components were responsive and performed well on various devices.",conclusion:"The Cross-Sell v3.0 module successfully delivered a comprehensive lead management solution that streamlined operations for all branch employees. The project reinforced the importance of clear specifications and user-centric design in developing effective enterprise tools. Key takeaways include the power of role-based UI customization for improving user adoption and the efficiency of using a robust state management solution like GetX for handling complex, dynamic data flows in a mobile application.",impact:"The new module is expected to significantly improve the lead conversion rate by ensuring timely assignment and action on leads. It enhances accountability by providing clear visibility into lead statuses for all stakeholders.

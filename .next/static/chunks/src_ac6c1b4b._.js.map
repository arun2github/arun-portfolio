The lack of a centralized system made it difficult to monitor lead status and measure conversion effectiveness across the branch network.\",\n    developmentJourney: \"The development of Cross-Sell v3.0 was guided by detailed user stories and Figma designs. The process began with building the core UI components in Flutter, such as the dynamic lead card widgets and the new landing page.

For Branch Managers, the design focused on providing a clear overview and quick assignment capabilities. For Relationship Managers, the focus was on enabling swift action on leads. The UI for lead submission was designed to be clean and straightforward, minimizing friction for all employees. The use of distinct tabs, clear call-to-action buttons, and structured lead cards was a direct result of design thinking aimed at improving user efficiency and satisfaction.\",\n    approach: \"The module was developed using Flutter with GetX for state management, following a modular architecture within the main Fincare One application.
